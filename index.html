•	Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?

This week’s topic is about self-discipline which the ability to focus on task or goals with the purpose of achieving them and be successful. It is so much important because as we strive to work as a team and accomplish common goals, we need to be organized, persistent, take some responsibilities, have a strong work ethic and develop good working habits without these, it will be quite difficult for team members to be successful individually and as a team.

•	How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?

I have been self-disciplined in my life without even knowing it. I have sets goals, learned how to set good habits, found ways to be focused on those goals and work toward them, I have also learned that failures and challenges are part of life and should be as a source of motivation in our life and help us to be more determined. I have applied all that during my LDS mission and during my academic years. I have been so much blessed, and success was always ahead as I grew a new mindset.

•	How does your experience relate to other classmates’ experiences?

We shared our mission experiences and learned from their experiences as they were on mission too and how they were able to apply exact obedience and be diligent in all they did and all that was possible because they decided to be self-disciplined. 

•	Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn that they didn’t know before?

I taught my roommate about what we learned in class that all begin with doing our bed in the morning and we are all able to develop good habits and be successful, it was very insightful as he shared his personal experiences with me.

•	If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel?

I would have related it to the Christlike attribute of diligence and the teaching of the natural Man who is an enemy to God. We all can be who we want to be and improve and be successful. We need to develop a growth mindset.
