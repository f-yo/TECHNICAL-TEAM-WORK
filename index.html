•	Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?
During this week, I learned from the material how to avoid mistakes at work, how to react when you make some mistakes, how to improve our work life balance and in what way finding meaning at work is more important than feeling happy. All these topics are important in teamwork because we are called to work as a team and avoiding mistakes and knowing how to react when those mistakes occur will enable us to be more productive, be trusted by our teammates and accomplish the goals we set.

•	How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?
As we are all human and thus making mistakes, I plan to listen to teammates and understand them if any mistakes occur and plan for ways to be more effective together. All these in a good spirit.
•	How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?
I made mistakes in my life whether at school, with family or at the various work that I had in the pass. Learning this topic will help me be more efficient by avoiding mistakes and improving my doings. 


•	How does your experience relate to other classmates’ experiences?
We all made mistakes; all depends on how we plan to avoid them and be more productive. 

•	Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn that they didn’t know before?
As I shared this week topic, it was very insightful and new to know that to avoid mistakes, we need give full attention to what we are doing, avoid distractions, take breaks as we are working in order to keep our brain sharp, ask questions, create a check list to know our progress, be clear about our role and review our work when we are done. One very important part is that it is okay to make mistakes, only if we learn from them.
