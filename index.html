FRANCK SOKORA


•	My style

I plan and organize everything I need to do beforehand and focus on them during working time. I freely include new or unplanned tasks in my working schedule and make sure all gets done. I work one step at a time in an efficient and effective ways.  

•	What I value

I value proactivity, organization skill, time management, focus and creativity and I expect my teammates to be creative as well as being efficient in what they do. I value the spirit of communication and commitments in accomplishing goals. I also believe that the happiness of teammates and the environment in which we learn and work impacts productivity.

•	What I don't have patience for

I dislike laziness in the work and distractions during work whether individually or as a team.  Someone is most likely to lose my trust when mistreating or disrespecting teammates.

•	How best to communicate with me

I love to communicate with everyone and open to any suggestion as we try to solve problems. I love when reproaches are made in a gentle and constructive way.  

•	How to help me

I am usually an introvert person in the outside but have so much confidence in my abilities and skills and engaged in whatever I start. I am creative and I love challenges and solving problems. Meanwhile, I am kind of reserved when I don’t know people around me but immediately after one team project, I can give the best of my abilities. I am actively working on it and strongly believe that this can come earlier as I am introduced in a warmed and welcoming group.

•	What people misunderstand about me

People usually believe that I am shy and not talkative which is not true. Like I said earlier, I am very talkative, confident and engaged in what I start. I am a friendly person and enjoy working as a team to solve problems. My experiences have shown that I have always been an essential element in teams increasing team productivity by 15%
