•	Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?

This week’s topic is important because it teaches us how to be a professional for today’s workforce. It is so much important in teamwork because we are working in the information technology, and we are called to work as team in practically all the job we will have to do. So, for us to be successful personally and as a team, we need to learn how to integrate ethic in our behavior and be a professional worker.

•	How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?

From the topic that we studied and my personal preparation, I have learned that a professional worker needs to be accountable, he needs to know how to communicate clearly and effectively with all team members, be aware of how his behavior can affect the people around him, be consistent and mostly keep his words. These are the skills that I will work on and apply in my team in week 6

•	How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?

During my mission, I had applied all these skills with the help of the spirit, I had to work as a team with different people from different background. Now I am trying to apply it at school and prepare for workforce.

•	How does your experience relate to other classmates’ experiences?
Most of my group members have served a mission too and I know that it will be easier to understand each other and rely on each other’s strength and skills.


•	Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn that they didn’t know before?
I shared the topic with my roommate, we had a little issue based on opinion but after sharing the topic we learned that we need to treat each other with respect and kindness and learn how to communicate. We then read the scriptures and prayed together that night.
•	If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel?
I would relate this topic to the Christlike attribute, Jesus Christ was an example of professionalism, he always knew what answer to give and how to deal with people around him in a loving manner.
